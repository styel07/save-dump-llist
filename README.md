Using a linked list, we are going to demonstrate a use case for a linked list and simulate a stack like you see in a stack trace (similar to what you see in your console when an error occurs), that replays the history of what we typed.

Add a text box to an HTML page and add 2 buttons, save and dump.
Every time the user clicks the first button to save, we are going to save the text input to our linked list as the most recent node or head.
Whenever someone clicks the dump button we are going to dump out all of the input they've typed in to that point from most recent to oldest. This should be written as HTML to the page.
